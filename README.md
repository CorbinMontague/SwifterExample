A working example of how to leverage [Swifter](https://github.com/httpswift/swifter) to mock network requests on iOS. This is particularly useful while running Unit or UI tests to avoid hitting live endpoints, allowing you to write more stable tests against mock data. Although Swifter's `stable` branch is synchronous, this example leverages solutions discussed in this [issue](https://github.com/httpswift/swifter/issues/306) to allow our UI tests to run in parallel.
